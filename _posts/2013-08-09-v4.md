&hellip;kinda. So I&rsquo;ve just released version 4 of my personal site. It&rsquo;s far from complete (more on that in a bit), but it&rsquo;s a decent enough starting point.

The site is hosted on [github](https://github.com/lukemartin/lukemartin.github.com/), generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), written (mostly) in Markdown, CSS is preprocessed with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com), and everything&rsquo;s tied together nicely with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). The Grunt usage in this project alone deserves a post of it&rsquo;s own, so I&rsquo;ll try to write that soon.

My [TODO list](https://github.com/lukemartin/lukemartin.github.com/blob/master/TODO.md) still has a lot on it &mdash; priorities are 404s, removing some lazy mystery meat navigation, and then getting as much content in as possible.
